#APIs #OOP #JSON #DOM


Features:
- Scoring system bubbles up highest scored comment/reply to top.
- New comments and replies are saved directly to the database and automatically rendered.
- Each comment/reply can edited, deleted or replied to.
- Automatically tag the person being replied to.
- Replies and edit can be cancelled by second click on button or by CANCEL button.
- All content can be saved by both button click and Enter keypress.


To be developed:
- Date and time of comment to be noted and saved to the comment object and be recalculated to be shown as time passed on refresh. (ie. 2 weeks ago, 2 hours ago, 34 seconds ago)
